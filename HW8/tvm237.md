CLARITY:

The plot is easy to understand, but it may not need the 3D plot, 2D plot is enough I think.

ESTHETIC:

Five bright colors are used to discriminate different races, and the graphical choices are allowing me to focus on the right elements.

HONESTY:

The plot is honestly reproducing the data, not to deform it.
