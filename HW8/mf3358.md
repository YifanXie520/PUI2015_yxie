CLARITY:

This plot is easy to read, and it is clear, and the quantities are visualized clearly. However, the dots in plot are discreted, so some transform approaches may need to be used.

ESTHETIC:

Different colors make the plot more beautiful and the choices of colors are appropriate.

HONESTY:

The plot is honestly reproducing the data, not to deform it.
